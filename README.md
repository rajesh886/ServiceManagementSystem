# ServiceManagementSystem
This application was built in an Android Studio using firebase database. It Minimum SDK version for running this app is 4.0. 
This android application will help users initiate “service request” for their home or small business. This will help users (i.e. customers that require service) to be put in contact with service providers. You will make money by collecting commission from each service request fulfilled by the service provider. The categories of services (displayed graphically by an icon) can be expanded to cover more service areas in the future. Initially the listed services should be supported.  The system contains the following components:
1.	Login & Registration: Customers (i.e. Service Requesters) can optionally register and login to the system.To register, they must provide full name, email, and phone number.
2.	Setup: Setup control fields such as: Sounds on/off, receive commission yes/no, use points toward a service yes/no. feel free to include other parameters. The Bold charters will be the default(Not completed yet)

4.	Register to become an approved vendor for one or more of the above service categories (i.e. Service Provider). You must provide contact info including phone, address and email. You can optionally provide sample rates (e.g. how much to fix something, or per hour of labor). You must also agree to pay a small portion of money received (e.g. 20%) as fee to the app holder
5.	Place a Service Request (by Customers): Select a Service category and place an order solicitation for bid by the service providers. Finalize your selection after reviewing all bids.
